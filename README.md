✈️ Flight Delays and Cancellation Dashboard

Overview
This project is an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze flight delays and cancellations in the United States.
The dashboard was created as part of my learning journey in data analysis and visualization through YouTube tutorials.

It provides insights into:

* Flight delays by airline and airport
* Reasons for cancellations
* Delay trends over time
* Comparative performance of airlines

* `airports.csv` → Airport information (IATA codes, names, locations)
* `cancellation_codes.csv` → Mapping of cancellation codes to reasons
